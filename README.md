# CS 330 Final Project – 3D Scene and Design Decisions

## Reflection

### How do I approach designing software?

Working on this project helped me improve my ability to design software by focusing on planning, structure, and visual layout. I learned how to break a big scene down into smaller, manageable 3D shapes, and how to combine them to form complex objects like a lamp, desk, or iPad. I also practiced identifying what parts of the design needed color, texture, or lighting to make it feel realistic.

My design process started with choosing a real-world 2D image and then analyzing the major objects in it. From there, I planned which 3D shapes (like cylinders, spheres, or boxes) could be used to recreate each object. I used OpenGL tools and applied transformations (scaling, translation, rotation) to build the final scene.

This structured approach helped me stay organized and efficient. I can apply this tactic in future software work, especially when I need to plan and visualize features before building them.

### How do I approach developing programs?

This project helped me improve my development skills by teaching me to build a program step by step. I used new strategies such as working with transformation matrices, camera navigation, lighting, and texture mapping. I also learned to debug issues as they came up and update my code through several iterations.

Iteration was key to my success. I made small improvements with each milestone—adding more shapes, improving lighting, adding textures, and eventually adding mouse and keyboard interactions. I learned how to test my code, take feedback, and build on my previous work. By the end of the project, I had a fully working 3D scene that looked and behaved the way I imagined.

Overall, my development approach has evolved. I now think more about structure and readability, and I’m more confident in applying best practices like commenting code and keeping things modular.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

This project taught me how powerful computational graphics and visualizations can be. I now understand how to build realistic 3D scenes from scratch, apply textures and lighting, and create interactive environments. These skills can help me in future courses that involve 3D modeling, game development, or UI/UX design.

Professionally, I can use these graphics skills in roles that involve simulations, product demos, architecture visualizations, or even entertainment. Employers are always looking for developers who understand how to turn code into visual, interactive results. This project showed me I can do that.
